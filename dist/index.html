    <h3>Vegeta Attributes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Superhuman Strength</strong> - As a Saiyan, Vegeta possesses immense physical strength, far more advanced than that of any human being, and most alien races. He is strong enough to effortlessly break all Earthling-made materials or weapons, move in increased gravity without any discomfort, and even lift a suit capable of sinking through a planet.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Superhuman Speed</strong> -  As an extremely experienced and trained Saiyan warrior, Vegeta can move and fly at hypersonic and eventually light speeds, enabling him the ability to travel great distances in short periods of time, or move at "untrackable" speeds while in combat.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Superhuman Durability</strong> - As a highly trained Saiyan, Vegeta's body is far more durable than that of normal human beings, being essentially invulnerable to all Earthling-made weapons.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Superhuman Senses</strong> -  Vegeta is able to think and react at extremely high speeds, easily able to dodge or catch projectiles fired from weapons, or even keep up with incredible combat speeds from his opponents. As a Saiyan, Vegeta also has enhanced senses of smell, taste and sight, which further increase his combat senses and instincts.
      </li>
    </ul>
